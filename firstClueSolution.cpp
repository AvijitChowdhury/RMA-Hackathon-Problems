/*
Welcome to the "RMA Tech Day-2021, Treasure Hunt Challenge"
One day you visited CUET and in front of the cuet gate you found a small piece
of paper which looked very old. You thought that you found a treasure hunt map
and curiously opened the paper and saw that “Tech Day-2021_Hackhathon” is
written on it. But you felt very sad that there was no clue on the paper about
the treasure hunt. So you started walking and suddenly you saw a small lock
attached with a small box. You found out that the sentence of your paper was the
password of that lock.

Now, print a program to print the password of this lock.
